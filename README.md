 S-ARM Control System UI

This project is a web-based control interface designed to manage both **robotic arm movements** and **base operations** as part of a modular S-ARM control system.

The system is divided into two independent UI modules for better separation of concerns and scalability.

🔹 Modules

 1. Arm Control UI
- Controls robotic arm movements and actions
- Focused on precision and modular control
